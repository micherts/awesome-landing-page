                hours before the end of the current Billing Cycle. If you vary
                your Membership and the Fees increase, we will charge you for
                the increase in the Fees on a pro-rata basis for the remainder
                of the period until the start of the next Billing Cycle, and you

                We may need to change what is available as part of your
                Membership (for example, the inclusions, exclusions, updated
                features) from time to time. If we change what is available as
                part of your Membership, we will provide you with at least 30
                days’ notice of the change. After the notice period has lapsed,
                we will apply the changes to your Membership. If the changes
                adversely affect your enjoyment of the Membership, you may
                cancel your Membership with effect from the date we apply the
                changes to your Membership by providing written notice to us. If
                you cancel your membership, (a) you will no longer be able to
                use the Platform on and from the date of cancellation, and (b)
                if you have paid Fees upfront you will be issued a pro-rata
                refund having regard to the date of termination and the period
                for which you have paid.

                the Fees, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the
                change. After 30 days’ , we will apply the updated Fee to your
                Membership. If the updated Fee is not acceptable to you, you may
                cancel your Membership in accordance with the ‘Cancellation of
                Memberships’ clause.

              <strong>Assignment of Debt:</strong>
              You agree that we may assign or transfer any debt owed by you to

              to resolve the dispute, failing which the Parties agree to engage
              a mediator to attempt to resolve the dispute. The costs of the
              mediation will be shared equally between the Parties. Nothing in
              this clause will operate to prevent a Party from seeking urgent
              injunctive or equitable relief from a court of appropriate
              jurisdiction.

              these Terms, and these Terms supersedes all previous discussions,
              communications, negotiations, understandings, representations,
              warranties, commitments and agreements, in respect of its subject
              matter.

            <li>
              <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Neither Party will be liable for
              any delay or failure to perform their respective obligations under
              these Terms if such delay or failure is caused or contributed to
              by a Force Majeure Event, provided the Party seeking to rely on
              the benefit of this clause, as soon as reasonably practical,
              notifies the other party in writing about the Force Majeure Event
              and the extent to which it is unable to perform its obligations
              and uses reasonable endeavours to minimize the duration and
              adverse consequences of the Force Majeure Event.

              If a provision of these Terms is held to be void, invalid, illegal
              or unenforceable, that provision is to be read down as narrowly as
              necessary to allow it to be valid or enforceable, failing which,
              that provision (or that part of that provision) will be severed
              from these Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability
              of the remainder of that provision or the other provisions in
              these Terms.
