          Overhead control is critical to your cafe's stability and
          profitability.
        </p>
        <h5>4 Tricks & Techniques</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Establish a budget:</b> When there is no clear budget, there is
            often no clear future. A well-thought-out cafe budget will help you
            limit your costs and plan for the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Determine your overheads:</b> Make a detailed list of all
            overhead expenses, including but not limited to lease fees,
            electricity bills, insurance premiums, and equipment costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Track your overheads:</b> There is little point in creating a
            budget and recording overheads unless you intend to track and
            monitor them on a regular basis; it is common for operating expenses
            to spiral out of control due to a lack of frequent monitoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Educate your team:</b> Spend some time training your cafe staff
            on budgeting and cost awareness; this will allow them to be more
            accountable for overheads under their control and contribute to
            maintaining a healthy overhead margin, which means a sustainable
            bottom line. Share the responsibility and include your team; this
            will improve team culture, trust, and growth.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>3 Home Truths</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Profitability will decline:</b> Excessive expense can reduce
            profitability and make it difficult to stay in business. Given how
            difficult it can be to make a profit from caf√©s, you really don't
            need the additional stress that not knowing your overheads can
            bring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Extra Stress:</b> High overheads can put a strain on your cash
            flow, making it harder to pay invoices and suppliers on time. This
            is a dangerous slope from which it is difficult to recover.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reduced competitiveness:</b> If your overheads are consistently
            high, you may be forced to make shortcuts, raise menu pricing, and
            cut labour. This frequently results in a decline in client
            experience, which is never good news.
          </li>
        </ol>
