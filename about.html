      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        HospoSure brings together some of the best hospitality minds in
        Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our founders combine over 50 years of world-class experience mixing
        technological, operational, and financial skills into a user-friendly
        solution. We are proudly designed and manufactured in Australia by
        Aussies.
      </p>
      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        We have developed an easy-to-use cloud-based programme that provides
        both cafe entrepreneurs who are planning to open and those who are
        currently open for business with crucial training into how a cafe
        operation should function to ensure operational sustainability.
      </p>
      <h2>Why we do it</h2>
      <p>
        Up to 70% of cafes fail in the first year of business, and cafe leases
        are now changing hands in as little as a year. Nobody likes scare
        tactics, but the reality is without accurate business modelling and
        financial and operational understanding, your chances of success in the
        hospitality and cafe industry are slim.
      </p>
      <h2>How we do it</h2>
      <p>
        Our cafe planning software is the result of two years of development,
        extensive product testing, and real-life user case studies. It combines
        expert coaching notes with high-level technology and flawless reports.
      </p>
      <h2>What does this mean for you?</h2>
      <p>
        Superb user experience, extensive lightning-fast results, vast compound
        growth of cafe operational knowledge, personal risk reduction, and
        increased chances of cafe success.
      </p>
      <h2>What's next?</h2>
      <p>
        Our in-house technology and operations teams are exploring the
        introduction of integrational technologies to enable 360-degree
        pre-opening education to ongoing cafe operations, enabling total
        visibility into operations for the life of your cafe.
